Delegate: it is a type-safe function pointer

-A delegate holds the reference of a method and then calls the method for execution

if a method is static we will not add a delegate

if we want to create a delegate the return type and parameter should be the same as the method

delegate is a reference type
To call a method by using a delegate we have 3 steps:

1. Define a delegate

[<modifiers>] deligate type<name>([<parameter list>])

2. instance of delegate

we have to pass the method name as the parameter to the delegate constructor

3. Now call the delegate by passing the required parameter values, so that internally the method which is bound with the delegate gets executed
